**_Written in C Language._**

A reference program that I built with inspiration.

> I will try to explain some part of the program.

# Arithmetic

Compute 2 given numbers using a selected arithmetic.

> Arithmetics:
>
> - Sum
> - Subtract
> - Multiply
> - Divide

Get the area of a rectangle by multiplying the height and width of the rectangle.

> Formula: Area = h \* w

---

# Array

Modify the value of an Array

- Add

  > Modify the array by adding a value

- Edit

  > Modify the array by changing the value from given index

- Delete

  > Modify the array by deleting 1 index-value at a time

- Print
  > Print and/or modify the array by sort-print and/or reverse-print then saving it

---

# Recursion

A function that use itself repeatedly like a loop to compute.

- Find factors of a number

  > Formula: n! = 1 • 2 • 3 • 4 • … • n

- Find the nth term of Fibonacci
  > Formula: Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2

#### Create Fibonacci Sequence.

`Note: This is not include in the program.`

> Explain: nth term of Fibonacci series is sum of (n-1)th term and (n-2)nd term.
> Adding the last two integer from the sequence and continuing it we can create a Fibonacci Sequence.

---

# String

A program that can check if the two string has same length and/or same value

- Set the first string (String A)
- Set the second string (String B)

# "Thanks for using our program"
