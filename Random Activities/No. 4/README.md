___Emphasis of this task is to create your own function___

> Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. 
If the score is out of range, print an error. 
If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:

***Score Grade***
> - \>= 0.9 A
> - \>= 0.8 B
> - \>= 0.7 C
> - \>= 0.6 D
> - < 0.6 F

> If the user enters a value out of range, print a suitable error message and exit. For the test, enter a score of 0.85.
> In making this program, use a function called computergrade which will automatically assign the letter grade based on the input of the user.
